# Learning Distributional Semantics with the SGNS Model

Without ML libraries in this in this assignment, I implemented the SkipGram model with Negative Sampling (SGNS).

Additionally, I implement a Semantle game on "Harry Potter" first book.


Objectives:
- Better understanding of the training process based on word corpus.
- Better understand the logistic regression and the use of Loss functions, Gradient descent and back propagation.
- Better understand distributional semantics, uses and limitations.
- Get hands-on experience with probabilistic language models by implementing the entire algorithmic pipeline.
